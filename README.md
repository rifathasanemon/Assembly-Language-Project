Smart System

- In This Program We have 4 main parts (home or not, take temperature, lights status, possibility of
-            finding smoke inside the house)

- 	1: determine if the user is in or not 
-		 H: he is inside, O: if he is outside 
-	2: take the temperature 
- 	should be between 16 and 40 ==> and keeps going down as long as it is >= 16'
- 3: ask the user about what they are planning to do with the light whether turn it on or off  
-		Y for on, N for off 
-	4: check with the user if there is any smoke
-	Y for yes , N for no
-           5:  in case there is no smoke the system will only display “Have a nice day of your own 
-                            home!”
-            6:  in case there is smoke the system will ask the user to immediately get out of the house 
-                       and the power will be cut out
